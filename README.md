# What is this?

It's a note taking under developmenet made with Svelte and Vite. Build it or download a build. The app is just an index.html file. Place it on your web server in a folder. In the same folder, create a data.yml file. Use example_data.yml to inspire yourself. Use images too: X.jpg for cards and qX.jpg for questions (where X is a number).
